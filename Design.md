# Sports Statistics

## Overview

I was hired by the Bytechester Rovers footbal club to build a software application that will keep track of their teams statistics. 
They want to use C# and Blazor to deliver the product.
They also need the ability to show data charts to help their coaches visualize the players performances.

### Requirements

- [ ] This is an application that will track and generate reports about a sports team's performance.
- [ ] The app will have a page divided two areas: The UI where the in-game data will be tracked and an area showing the current statistics.
- [ ] The app will have a reports area in a different page showing the players statistics across multiple games. Coaches should be able to see detailed players information per game and per season. This area should contain barcharts with the players performance.
- [ ] The UI needs to contain a list of players with 5 parameters that will be tracked (i.e. passes, shots, tackles, dribbles, headers).
- [ ] Data should be tracked with the click of a button. (i.e. a pass button clicked on John Smith's row will track a pass at a given time in the game).
- [ ] The reports area should be updated immediately upon a button being clicked.

### Additional Requirements

- [ ] Admin area to manage the team (current players and fixtures/games).
- [ ] Authentication and authorization (Roles: Administator, Viewer)

##  High-Level Design

### 1. **Frontend (Blazor Server)**
- Role-based UI rendering using [AuthorizeView] in Blazor  
- Secure routing (e.g. `/admin` only accessible to Admins)
**Pages/Components**
- **Match Tracker Page**  
  - Player list grid with live buttons (passes, shots, etc.)  
  - Real-time statistics panel  
- **Reports Page**  
  - Game and season selector  
  - Interactive charts (bar charts per player and game)  
  - Detailed player breakdown panel  
- **Admin Area**  
  - **Team Management**
    - Add/edit/remove players  
    - Assign player positions
  - **Fixture/Game Management**
    - Schedule fixtures  
    - Update game details (opponent, date, lineup)

### 2. **Backend Services (C# .NET Core)**
**Core Responsibilities**
- Handle tracking inputs and timestamp actions  
- Aggregate and serve player statistics  
- Sync real-time updates to the frontend  
- Save and retrieve historical data per match/season
- Admin-specific APIs for CRUD operations on Players and Fixtures  
- Ensure audit tracking if needed (who made changes, when)
- Integrate **ASP.NET Core Identity** for user management  
- Extend default `IdentityUser` with a linked profile or reference to `Coach` or `TeamStaff` if needed  
- Define roles:  
  - **Administrator**: Full access to tracker, reports, and admin tools  
  - **Viewer**: Read-only access to reports/statistics

### 3. **Database Layer**
** SQL Server
- `UserRoles` (tied to Identity)  
- Extend `Game` and `Player` entities to be admin-manageable  

**Data Models**
- `Player` (name, position, ID)  
- `MatchEvent` (player ID, match ID, type, timestamp)  
- `Game` (date, opponent, match ID)  
- `Statistics` (aggregated data by player and game)

### 4. **Charting Library**
**Recommended**: ChartJs, ApexCharts, or Telerik UI for Blazor

**Purpose**
- Render dynamic bar charts instantly upon stat changes  
- Support filtering by player, match, or stat type

### 5. **Data Sync Logic**
- Button clicks trigger async service calls  
- Server processes and stores data  
- Statistics UI and charts re-render via signalR

# Low-Level Design Document  
**Project**: Bytechester Rovers ï¿½ Team Statistics Tracker  
**Technology Stack**: C#, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, Charting Library  
**Author**: Chris Carter
**Date**: 2025-07-04
**Version**: 0.1

## 1. Purpose  

This Low-Level Design (LLD) document provides a detailed blueprint for the implementation of a football statistics tracking application commissioned by Bytechester Rovers FC. The primary goal is to deliver a responsive, real-time system that captures match data and visualizes individual and team performance for coaches, analysts, and stakeholders.

The application will be developed using C# and Blazor, leveraging modern component-driven architecture and a clean, modular codebase. Key features include:

- Real-time in-game tracking of player statistics via an intuitive UI.
- Dynamic reporting and visualization of performance data across fixtures and seasons.
- Role-based authentication and authorization to support administrators and viewers.
- Administrative tools to manage players, fixtures, and system data.

This document outlines the internal structure, component responsibilities, data flows, and integration patterns required to achieve a scalable, maintainable, and user-centric solution.

- Add a new **Aspire ServiceDefaults** project:
  - Name: `SportsStatistics.ServiceDefaults`

#### Set Up Project References

| From â To                             | Reason |
|--------------------------------------|--------|
| `Application` â `Domain`             | Use domain models in use cases |
| `Infrastructure` â `Application`     | Implement interfaces |

| `AppHost` â All other projects       | Aspire orchestration |
| `Shared` â All other projects        | If using shared utilities |

#### Setup SQL Server and EF Core

- Add the following packages in AppHost:
  - `Aspire.Hosting.SqlServer`

- Add the following packages in Infrastructure:
  - `Aspire.Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`
  - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`
  - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design`

  - `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools`

- Create `SportsStatisticsDbContext` in `Persistence/`

- Configure DbContext in `Web` via DI:
  ```csharp
  builder.AddSqlServerDbContext<SportsStatisticsDbContext>("sportsstatistics-db");
  ```

#### Integrate with Aspire
- In `AppHost`, register services:
  ```csharp
  var sqlServer = builder.AddSqlServer("sql");
  var database = sqlServer.AddDatabase("sportsstatistics-db")
  builder.AddProject<Projects.SportsStatistics_Web>("sportsstatistics-web");
  ```

### **Configure Basic Routing & Layout**

- Establish main pages: Home, Match Tracker, Reports, Admin
- Add navigation and layout components
- TODO:
  - Layout
  - Signin, Register, Logout

#### Define Page Components

Create Razor pages for each main route in `SportsStatistics.Web/Pages/`:

| Page Name        | File Name                   | Route             | Purpose |
|------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|---------|

Update the existing `DbContext` to inherit from `IdentityDbContext`.

```csharp
public class SportsStatisticsDbContext : IdentityDbContext<ApplicationUser>
{
    public SportsStatisticsIdentityDbContext(DbContextOptions<SportsStatisticsDbContext> options)
        : base(options) { }
}
```

#### Register Identity Services

In `InfrastructureServiceRegistration.cs` of `SportsStatistics.Infrastructure`:

```csharp

builder.Services.AddIdentityCore<ApplicationUser>(options =>
{
  options.Password.RequiredLength = 6;
  options.Password.RequireDigit = true;
  options.Password.RequireLowercase = true;
  options.Password.RequireUppercase = true;
  options.Password.RequireNonAlphanumeric = true;
  options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = false;

- Add the following properties:
  - `bool Success`
  - `string Message`
  - `int MigrationsApplied = 0`
  - `TimeSpan Duration = default`
  - `Exception? Exception = null`
