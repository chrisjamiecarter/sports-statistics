# Sports Statistics

## Design Overview

I was hired by a Bytechester Rovers footbal club to build a software application that will keep track of their teams statistics. 
They want to use C# and Blazor to deliver the product.
They also need the ability to show data charts to help their coaches visualize the players performances.

## Requirements

- [ ] This is an application that will track and generate reports about a sports team's performance.
- [ ] The app will have a page divided two areas: The UI where the in-game data will be tracked and an area showing the current statistics.
- [ ] The app will have a reports area in a different page showing the players statistics across multiple games. Coaches should be able to see detailed players information per game and per season. This area should contain barcharts with the players performance.
- [ ] The UI needs to contain a list of players with 5 parameters that will be tracked (i.e. passes, shots, tackles, dribbles, headers).
- [ ] Data should be tracked with the click of a button. (i.e. a pass button clicked on John Smith's row will track a pass at a given time in the game).
- [ ] The reports area should be updated immediately upon a button being clicked.
