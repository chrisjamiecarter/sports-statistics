## 🧠 UX Considerations

- Toasts for success/failure (`FluentToastProvider`)
- Confirmation modal before delete
- Inline validation messages
- Loading spinners for async actions
- Role-based access: restrict to Admins

## 🧩 Bonus Ideas

- Add avatar upload (with preview)
- Track player stats inline (goals, assists)
- Export player list to CSV or PDF (later phase)
- Add “inactive” toggle for retired or benched players
