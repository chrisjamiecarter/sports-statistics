Great—fixture management is a juicy domain with lots of modeling nuance. Let’s sketch out a clean, scalable design from Domain to Web, keeping it composable and testable. I’ll assume this is for a football context (Bytechester Rovers style), but let me know if it’s for something else.

## ⚽ Domain Layer

### 📦 Entities

**Fixture**
- `FixtureId` (value object)
- `HomeTeam` / `AwayTeam` (TeamId or Team reference)
- `KickoffTime` (UTC DateTime)
- `Venue` (string or Venue entity)
- `Status` (enum: Scheduled, Completed, Postponed, Cancelled)
- `Score` (optional: Score value object with HomeGoals, AwayGoals)
- `Referee` (optional: string or PersonId)
- `Competition` (e.g. League, Cup)

**Team**
- `TeamId`
- `Name`
- `ClubColors`
- `LogoUrl` (optional)

**Score** (Value Object)
- `HomeGoals`
- `AwayGoals`

### 🎯 Enums

- `FixtureStatus`: Scheduled, Completed, Postponed, Cancelled
- `CompetitionType`: League, Cup, Friendly, Tournament

### 📜 Domain Events

- `FixtureScheduled`
- `FixtureUpdated`
- `FixtureCompleted`
- `FixturePostponed`
- `FixtureCancelled`

## 🧠 Application Layer

### 🧾 Commands

- `ScheduleFixtureCommand`
  - HomeTeamId, AwayTeamId, KickoffTime, Venue, CompetitionType

- `UpdateFixtureCommand`
  - FixtureId, KickoffTime?, Venue?, Referee?, Status?

- `RecordFixtureResultCommand`
  - FixtureId, HomeGoals, AwayGoals

- `CancelFixtureCommand`
  - FixtureId, Reason?

- `PostponeFixtureCommand`
  - FixtureId, NewDateTime, Reason?

### 🔍 Queries

- `GetFixtureByIdQuery`
- `GetFixturesByTeamQuery`
- `GetUpcomingFixturesQuery`
- `GetFixturesByDateRangeQuery`
- `GetCompletedFixturesQuery`

### 🧩 DTOs

- `FixtureDto`
  - FixtureId, HomeTeamName, AwayTeamName, KickoffTime, Status, Score, Venue

- `TeamDto`
  - TeamId, Name, LogoUrl

---

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Layer

### 🗃️ Persistence Models

- `FixtureEntity`
  - Maps to Fixture aggregate
  - Includes foreign keys for teams, venue, competition

- `TeamEntity`
- `ScoreEmbedded` (if using EF Core owned types)

### 🛠️ Repositories

- `IFixtureRepository`
  - `Add`, `Update`, `GetById`, `GetByTeam`, `GetUpcoming`, etc.

- `ITeamRepository`

### 🧪 Data Seeding / Migrations

- Seed initial fixtures for testing
- Seed teams and competitions

---

## 🌐 Web Layer (Blazor or API)

### 📥 Pages / Endpoints

- `/fixtures`
  - List view: upcoming, completed, filters

- `/fixtures/{id}`
  - Detail view: teams, score, status, actions

- `/admin/fixtures/create`
  - Form for scheduling fixture

- `/admin/fixtures/{id}/edit`
  - Update kickoff, venue, status

- `/admin/fixtures/{id}/result`
  - Record score

### 🧾 ViewModels

- `FixtureViewModel`
  - For display: formatted kickoff time, team logos, status badge

- `FixtureFormModel`
  - For create/edit forms

---

## 🧠 Bonus Considerations

- **Validation**: Kickoff must be in future when scheduling; score only allowed if status is Completed.
- **Time Zones**: Store in UTC, display in user’s local time.
- **Audit Trail**: Track who scheduled/updated fixtures.
- **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable fixture editing based on status or role.
